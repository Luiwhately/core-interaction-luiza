        In one of my favorite movies, 'The Wizard of Oz', the movie starts out in black and white. When Dorothy emerges from the
        little house into the Land of Oz, everything changes to color. 
        <br>
        <br>
        'The Wizard of Oz' was the first color movie which was a commercial success. A magical moment for every moviegoer. Before that, films didnâ€™t look like the world we see every day. 
        Maybe what makes this movie so special to me, is this exact moment where everything becomes colorful. It immediately bring brightness and emotions to me.
