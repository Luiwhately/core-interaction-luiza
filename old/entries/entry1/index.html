COLOR EXPRESSION</strong>
</header>

<body><pre>
 <DIV>
  In one of my favorite movies, 'The Wizard of Oz', the movie starts out in black and white. When Dorothy emerges from the
  little house into the Land of Oz, everything changes to color. 
  <br>
  when I was little, people would ask me which color was my favorite,
  and my answer would always be <i>"I love all colors."</i>
  <br>
  cliche? maybe.
  <br>
  but totally honest.
  Colors have come to me in form of <i>life</i>
  <br>
  'The Wizard of Oz' was the first color movie which was a commercial success. A magical moment for every moviegoer.
  Before that, films didn’t look like the world we see every day and this would be the reality of television and photography at
  the time. Maybe what makes this movie so special to me, is this exact moment where everything becomes extremily saturated.
  It is an immediate connection with emotions.
  <br>
  Color has the power of communication. Our eyes will remain longer on a colored object than a colorless one. Color makes objects
  somehow more familiar and inviting. Objects with no color seem cold and distant.
  <br>
  Looking back in time, Charlie Chapling, the well-known star of the silent movie era had a big change in 1918, when his show started
  to be a colored movie series.
  <br>
  "Instead of the black-and-white icon of pluck and pathos, we thought we knew, we meet a creature of flesh and blood. The pinkish
  tone of the cheek; the myriad colors evident in the vest; the shadows playing on Chaplin’s brow and neck — all of these details sharpen
  our interest in Chaplin the man, just as his films spark admiration for Chaplin the artist." said a TIME writer Ben Cosgrove.
  <br>
  Colors are directly related to emotions.
  <br>
  The creation of colored photography, and films, are for me a turning point for relating memories and emotions, which nowadays, with all
  the technology developed can be seen literally everywhere we look.
  <br>
  What would be a 2023 world without color? 
  For me, cold, and non-existent.
